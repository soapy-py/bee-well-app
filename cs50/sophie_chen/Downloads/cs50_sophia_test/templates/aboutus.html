Your emotions are valid, and by acknowledging them, you take control of your mental health.

            <h1>How does our app work?</h1> 
            <div class="text">
                <p>Our app helps you track and explore your feelings through journaling, using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze your entries. When you log your thoughts, our system identifies the most prominent emotion from 28 possible categories and matches it with a color-coded mood aura. Inspired by Spotify’s Audio Aura concept, these colors give you a simple and intuitive way to visualize your emotional state and identify patterns over time.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>What do the colors mean?</h2>   
            <div class="text">
                <p>We’ve grouped emotions into six unique aura categories to help you better understand your mood. A <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> aura represents joy and inspiration, including emotions like admiration, amusement, excitement, and surprise. A <span style="color: green;">green</span> aura, tied to introspection and calm, reflects feelings such as confusion, curiosity, realization, relief, and neutrality. For moments of love and positivity, a <span style="color: pink;">pink</span> aura captures emotions like love, gratitude, optimism, and pride. An <span style="color: orange;">orange</span> aura reflects intense emotions such as anger, annoyance, desire, nervousness, and disgust. A <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span> aura, representing growth and support, includes approval, caring, fear, ambition, and disappointment. Finally, a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> aura reflects emotional depth and reflection, covering sadness, grief, remorse, embarrassment, and disapproval.</p>
                <p>With every journal entry, our app helps you track your emotional journey and see your mood evolve over time. These visualizations make it easy to identify patterns, spot triggers, and take actionable steps toward improving your mental health. At Bee Well, we’re here to empower you to embrace your emotions, gain insight into your mental well-being, and take control of your emotional journey.
